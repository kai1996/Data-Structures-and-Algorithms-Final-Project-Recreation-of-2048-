# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Final-Project-Recreation-of-2048-

We tried to recreate the popular game 2048 from scratch in Java. The game is a single player sliding bloack puzzle based on a 2D board that consists of a number of tiles. The aim is to combine the tiles and get the sum of "2048" on a single tile. The original game can be found here:
